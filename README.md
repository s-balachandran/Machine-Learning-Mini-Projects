# Machine-Learning-Mini-Projects
Mini projects on Jupyter Notebooks 

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks which I have worked on as a way to practice applying machine learning knowledge. 
 
All the datasets are available on kaggle (links within notebooks).

If the notebooks are not loading properly, please copy the URL for the notebook and enter it in this website: 
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). It should render then. 

Alternatively, you can view the notebooks on my [Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/KaggleUser654/notebooks).

The projects are:

1. Asteroid Classification (binary logistic regression, SVM, visualising decision boundaries)
2. Mall Segmentation (k-means clustering, average silhouette method, interactive 3D visualisations with Plotly)
3. Medical Costs Prediction (linear regression with batch gradient descent)
4. Predicting Rain in Australia (binary logistic regression, missing values, feature selection and engineering, learning curves)
